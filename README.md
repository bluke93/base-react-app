# Basic React App
Ready to use basic React App.<br>
Basic structure with routing, layout, views and styles (scss).

## Project setup
Cloning and installing all dependencies should be enough to have an app ready to use and get to work.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluke93/base-react-app.git
cd base-react-app
npm install
```
> can be used both `yarn` and `npm`. Preferably use `npm` to keep just one package manager in use. 

## Running

To run the app in the development mode.<br />
A browser window will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).<br/>The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm start
```


Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

```
npm test
```


Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

```
npm build
```
